## Elections Assistant - Devolved Parliaments Focus

Democracy Club is a non-partisan community interest company which builds online voter information tools for UK elections. Our vision is of a country with the digital foundations to support everyone’s participation in democratic life. We’re a small, distributed team who work openly; our partners include The Electoral Commission, local authorities, and a wide range of media companies and similar organisations.

2021 will see one of the largest and most complex sets of elections the UK has ever experienced: local elections in England; Police and Crime Commissioners in England and Wales; the Greater London Authority; and the devolved parliaments of Scotland and Wales. In order to ensure that we achieve the greatest impact during these elections, we’re seeking a fixed-term Elections Assistant to help with the administration and dissemination of our voter information tools. Although this role will touch upon all regions of the UK, it will involve a specific focus on the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Parliament/Senedd Cymru.

This non-technical role would suit someone with an enthusiasm for democracy and democratic participation, and a commitment to getting the details right. We don’t have an ideal candidate in mind and are happy to modify the role to suit individual interests/specialisms, so if you think this sounds like your sort of thing please don’t hesitate to get in touch!


### Main responsibilities:

* Help us partner with every English, Welsh and Scottish local authority to obtain data for [our polling station finder](https://wheredoivote.co.uk/). This involves using CRM software to track progress and deal with problems and queries as they arise.

* Contribute to, manage, and monitor [our candidates database](https://candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/), and help develop voter information resources to be displayed on our popular [candidate look-up site](https://whocanivotefor.co.uk/).

* Proactively seek out potential partners and data re-users: local journalists and newspapers; universities; community organisations (eg. encourage them to use our tools on their website).

* Build awareness of Democracy Club and its services, especially across Wales/Scotland, both for May 2021 and in anticipation of the local elections in 2022.

* Contribute to Democracy Club’s wider elections output and partnership work.

To get a better feel for what we do and what the role will involve, take a scroll down our blog and have a read of [our report on the 2019 general election](https://democracyclub.org.uk/report_2019_general_election/).

### Benefits
