<h2>What do we want to do?</h2>
<p>We want to create an open dataset of polling station locations matched to
  addresses. We intend to encourage leading media organisations (e.g. Google,
  Facebook) and councils to use the data and we will also provide an easy-to-use
  website for the public to access directly. </p>

<h2>Why is this important? </h2>
<p>One of the top search terms inputted into Google on the day of the 2015
  general election was ‘Where do I vote?’ This information is rarely online.
  Councils send citizens a polling card, but citizens might lose it or not have
  it available at the time they want to vote. We believe that thousands of people
  are disenfranchised by the lack of this information. It should be online.</p>

<h2>How do we propose to do it?</h2>
<p>We will use shape files from the councils to plot house addresses against
  polling stations - as councils do currently. We will make this data open so
  anyone can use it. We have begun working with some partner councils, and have
  a working prototype that we tested at the 2015 general election. We will begin
  full time work on this project for the 2016 elections in Nov 2015.</p>
