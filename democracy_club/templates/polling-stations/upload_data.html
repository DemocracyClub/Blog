**To send us data, please email the data or a link to the hosted version to [pollingstations@democracyclub.org.uk](mailto:pollingstations@democracyclub.org.uk).**

Please read our
[technical guide]({% url "polling_technical_explainer" %}) before sending the data over.

## 'Plus'-standard data

If you're able to publish Gold Plus or Silver Plus data, then all we need are the URLs for the data.

Please make sure that these URLs will be updated as the data changes. We have systems for checking
updates and flagging when we think
the data should have changed, but it's best to double check the internet IT process in your authority too.

## Gold and Silver standard data

For accuracy, we only use data for one election. Please send us new data for each election, or confirm that it has not changed.
