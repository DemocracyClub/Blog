      <p>We're a tiny team on a big mission to make it easy to get more and better information on election candidates and the democratic process.</p>
      <p>But this costs money! We need developers, designers, hosting, email servers...as well as people to talk to the press and work with other organisations.</p>
      <p>Please help us to do this with a donation.</p>
