      <h1>Democracy Club</h1>
      {% filter typogrify %}
      <p>
        Democracy Club is for a thriving democracy in the UK, where people
        feel they can engage politically with the state in a simple,
        easy-to-use and effective way.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Our mission</strong> is to create digital tools and datasets that help democracy.
        We focus on elections due to their high engagement levels.
        A core team builds the tools, hundreds of volunteers upload data, and
        we connect with organisations with large audiences to distribute the
        data in a user-friendly fashion. We encourage government to adopt these
        tools and datasets officially. </p>

    <h3>Lists of Candidates</h3>
    <p>
      There is no open dataset of candidates for elections in the UK. This means
      that citizens cannot easily discover who they can vote for at the next
      election. The lack of open data also means that media organisations,
      campaigners and academics cannot easily monitor candidates. An open
      dataset of candidates must exist to enable related products to exist, e.g.
      voter advice applications or records of speakers at hustings. A thriving
      democracy is a transparent one.

    <h3>Polling stations</h3>
    <p>
      One of the top searched for terms on the day of the 2015
      general election was ‘Where do I vote?’ This information is rarely
      online. Councils send voters a polling card, but they might lose
      it or not have it available at the time they want to vote. We believe
      that thousands of people are disenfranchised by the lack of this
      information. It should be online.
