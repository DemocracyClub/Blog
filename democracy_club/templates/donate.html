<p>Do you love democracy? Have you found our tools useful? </p>

<p>We're a tiny team on a big mission to make simple tools that make it easy to find out more information on your local area, political representatives and elections.</p>

<p>In just a few months we’ve made an open database of candidate, a directory of public meetings, a way to view CVs of candidates and much much more.  We’ve been used by The Guardian, The Telegraph, The BBC, Google, 38 Degrees and many more.</p>

<p>Doing this costs money.  We need developers, designers, hosting, email servers and so on, as well as people to talk to the press and work with other organisations.</p>

<p>Importantly we think that these tools are needed in the times between elections, so we can get to work earlier and make future elections better than ever.</p>

<p>We would love your help with a one-off or regular donation. </p>
