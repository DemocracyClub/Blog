# Get involved

We're a very small and overworked team at the moment.  We're all in London, but working over the internet as we don't have the time to meet up very much.

We're very keen for anyone to get involved with the project.  Specifically we'd like: 

* **Project managers**.  We need someone to think about the whole project, and keep us in check.
* **Fund raisers**.  We're going to have to pay for something one day :)
* **Designers** at any level to help us with designing the tools and services.
* **Developers**.  Front and back end, there will be a lot to do.  Right now, someone who can work with [mySociety's components](http://www.mysociety.org/2012/07/04/mysocietys-components-strategy-our-take-on-small-pieces-loosely-joined/).

If you're keen on any of these, or you do something amazing that we've not thought of, please get in touch via the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/democracy-club).
