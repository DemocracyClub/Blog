<h2>Task: find a list of wards up for election</h2>

<h3>1. Go to the <a href="{{ object.authority.website }}" target="_blank">council's web site</a></h3>
<p>Often you're looking for something called 'election notices'.  These are normally PDFs.</p>
<p>
  {% if object.authority.election_urls %}
    {% if object.authority.election_urls.1 %}
      We think you'll find this information on one of these pages:
      <ul>
        {% for url in object.authority.election_urls %}
          <li><a href="{{ url }}" target="_blank">{{ url }}</a></li>
        {% endfor %}
      </ul>
    {% else %}
 You might be able to find <a href="{{ object.authority.election_urls.0.URL }}"target="_blank"><strong>more information about the elections here</strong></a>
    {% endif %}
  {% endif %}
</p>


<h3>2. Phone the council</h3>
    <p>If the web site doesn't tell you anything useful, you can <a href="tel:{{ object.authority.phone }}"><strong>call them on {{ authority.phone }}</strong></a> and:</p>
  <ol class="indent">
    <li>Ask to speak to their Democratic or Electoral services team</li>
    <li>Ask that team what wards are up for election on the 5th of May</li>
    <li>Remember that the council will get a lot of calls, so you might be put on hold or not be able to speak with the right person on your first call.</li>
  </ol>

<h3>3. Select the wards that are up for election below:</h3>
<form method=post>
  {% csrf_token %}
  {{ form.as_p }}
  <button type=submit>Submit</button>
</form>
