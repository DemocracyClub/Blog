## Elections assistant

This is a short-term contract for someone who can help us make a giant leap in voter information for the local elections next May.

### What’s happening next year?

We’re hoping to boost informed turnout at the local elections on 2 May 2019. Around 30 million people will have the chance to vote.

We hope that our polling location data and finder (Where Do I Vote?) will cover all councils and that we’ll have useful information on every candidate (Who Can I Vote For?).

### What will you do?

* Help us partner with every local authority with elections next May to publish polling location data, including dealing with queries; tracking progress towards completion; and managing the workflow for dealing with errors reported by the public on the day
* Help us partner with more data re-users: pitch to local journalists and newspapers, campaigns and community organisations
* Get more and better data on candidates: work with parties, agents, candidates and our incredible network of volunteers
* Manage an open hustings database, with the possibility of running Democracy Club hustings too
* Help manage our team inbox and social media
* Help maintain our Trello boards
* Do some basic press and PR for Democracy Club
* ...and anything else you can convince us that you should work on :)

### What skills, experience and behaviours do you need?

* Polite, curious, critical thinker
* Good written communication skills
* Passionate about digital and democracy and the space where they meet
* Great social skills and the ability to work with people of high technical knowledge and none
* Organised — there will be lots of things happening at once
* Non-partisan (you should not be actively involved in any political party)

### Also, if you have any skills as a …

* Researcher / anthropologist
* Designer
* Coder

...that would be exciting.

### What we can offer:

* A chance to immerse yourself in civic technology, get up-to-speed in tech for good and digital, and to help save democracy.
* £10/hr
* Laptop supplied
* Exclusive Democracy Club stickers!

### I love democracy, this looks brilliant, how do I apply?
