Democracy Club is a non-partisan Community Interest Company that aims to make the _process_ of democracy better for everyone.

We believe that there is a lot of work needed to be done to bring the UK political system in the to digital age, and our tools are a start.

Some of the things we do are:

* Maintain a [list of candidates for elections](https://yournextmp.com).  Amazingly, there isn't a single public list of candidates provided by the state.  This list is an open dataset that can be reused by 3rd parties.  [Contact us](/contact/) if you are interested in using it.

* [Collect election leaflets](https://electionleaflets.org/) in a public archive.  Leaflets make up over 40% of campaign spending in the UK, but there is no oversight of what's being said on them.  We ask the public to snap a photo of leaflets put through their door so the world can see them.

* [Campaign to get polling station locations online](/blog/2015/05/07/why-we-think-we-need-digital-polling-station-finder/).  It's very hard to find out where you should vote.  We're trying to make it as easy as Googling "Where's my polling station".

* [Build lists of public debates about elections](http://meetyournextmp.com/).  Public debates or hustsings are a a great way to get to know about issues and candidates, but it can be hard to find out about them.

* Make applications using our own data.  At the 2015 election we made

## History

In 2010 7,000 non-partisan volunteers [got together](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8651258.stm) as Democracy Club and got stuck in doing a range of useful, simple activities like working out who all the candidates were, and collecting information about what they thought about major issues. But it was just an experiment, and one that was started a bit too close to the election to have much impact.


In 2015 we got bigger.  We build a list of candidates that got used by organisations like Google, 38 Degrees and The Guardian and many, many more.

We build the largest list of hustings in the UK, collected press mentions, election leaflets and CVs of each candidate.

We had over a million people use our tools, data and services, and now we're in the process of planning what the next 5 years should look like.

## Which side are you on?

Democracy Club is non-partisan. We do not support a party. We do not receive money from any party donors. We do not take policy positions - not even on things like the age of voting. We are concerned with collating data and building tools that enable people to be better informed.

## What happens after the election?

We imagine that there’s a role for a non-partisan organisation to continue to build tools and harness the crowd to constantly improve the state of democracy in the UK. There are also a lot more elections: local councils, devolved parliaments and assemblies, Police & Crime Commissioners, Mayoral and European elections. All of these elections could benefit from a more informed, better engaged electorate.

We see 2015 as a test run for something really big - something on a grand nationwide scale in 2020, where a better informed electorate results in a better election.

## Who are we?

We are a group of people who think that in these ultra-sceptical times there must be a bunch of other people out there who think that we can work together to make democracy just suck less.

<h3><a href="https://twitter.com/symroe">Sym Roe</a></h3>
<p>Sym is a developer and has worked in the open/government space for years. He runs Democracy Club partly by writing code and partly by working with others to build a community of organisations who want to work together.</p>

<h3><a href="https://twitter.com/j0e_m">Joe Mitchell</a></h3>
<p>Joe was born in Wales. He doesn't remember it. He thinks that our most tricky political problems are systemically linked by a lack of a democracy. A lack of transparency, accountability and public engagement in political decision-making. He thinks digital tools can begin to empower everyone to make democracy better. He can't code, so generally tries to encourage others.</p>

<h3><a href="http://tfgg.me/">Tim Green</a></h3>
<p>Tim worked on Democracy Club over the 2010 election and has created two other candidate sites, YourNextPCC and YourNextMEP. He thinks that lowering barriers to entry for understanding our system is critical if we want to improve UK democracy, and non-partisan online tools are the best way to achieve this. His day job is simulating atoms in computers or something. He lives in Oxford and likes loud music.</p>

<h3><a href="https://twitter.com/andylolz">Andy Lulham</a></h3>
<p>Andy is a developer, but for Democracy Club he spends most of his time politely replying to emails from election candidates and other website users. He thinks transparency is in almost everyone’s best interests.</p>

<h3><a href="https://twitter.com/mhl20">Mark Longair</a></h3>
<p>Mark is a developer working for mySociety on their Parliaments team; he's been working on development of YourNextMP, both as part of his day job and as a volunteer for Democracy Club.</p>
