## Who are Democracy Club?

Democracy Club is a large group of volunteers assisted by two full-time
coordinators: Sym Roe and Joe Mitchell. We’ve received funding from Rowntree
Trust and Google.org to make this project happen. Democracy Club is a
community interest company (#09461226)


## What do we want to do?

We want to create an open dataset of polling station locations matched to
addresses. We intend to encourage leading media organisations (e.g. Google,
Facebook) and councils to use the data and we will also provide an easy-to-use
website for the public to access directly.

## What’s our experience?

Democracy Club created [yournextmp.com](https://yournextmp.com) for the General Election,
crowdsourced the most accurate and comprehensive dataset of candidates and
received a million unique visitors. We also provided an API to allow media
groups like Google and most of the UK newspapers to use the data - reaching
millions more people. We built a prototype polling-station-finder for 2015,
which was used by West Berkshire Council.


## Why is this important?

One of the top search terms inputted into Google on the day of the 2015
general election was ‘Where do I vote?’ This information is rarely online.
Councils send citizens a polling card, but citizens might lose it or not have
it available at the time they want to vote. We believe that thousands of people
are disenfranchised by the lack of this information. It should be online.

## How do we propose to do it?
We will use shape files from the councils to plot house addresses against
polling stations - as councils do currently. We will make this data open so
anyone can use it. We have begun working with some partner councils, and have
a working prototype that we tested at the 2015 general election. We will begin
full time work on this project for the 2016 elections in Nov 2015.


## What if the data changes?

One of the advantages of digital data is that it is easier to update than
paper polling cards. If you publish to a web address, we will regularly check
the address. So all you need to do is ensure that when the data changes, you
republish to the same web address. Alternatively, you can email us with the
updates and we will make the changes within 24 hours.


## Isn’t this personal data?

No, we are not asking for the full Electoral Register, only property IDs or
shapefiles. Neither shapefiles nor UPRN data are personal data according to
the Data Protection Act.


## Are we allowed to publish the shapefiles?

Yes, shapefiles created from OS BaseMaps are allowed to be published under
‘presumption to publish’. You can read more about this here.


## Do you have a licence for UPRN data?
Yes, we have partnered with the Electoral Commission to use the data under
the OS PSMA end user licence.


## Why do you need UPRNs or shapefiles, can’t we just provide polling station locations?

Some postcodes can refer to more than one district, so we cannot just use
postcode data linked to stations for this task.


## Could we have a version of your polling station finder on our site?

Yes! This is relatively easy to do. [Please email us](mailto:pollingstations@democracyclub.org.uk).
