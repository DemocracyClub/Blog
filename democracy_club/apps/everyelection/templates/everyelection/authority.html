    <h3>Find a list of wards up for election</h3>

    <p>This authority has <strong>{{ object.percent_to_words }}</strong> of its seats up for election.</p>

    <p>This could mean that every ward has an election (some wards have more than one councillor), or it could mean that only some wards have one or more councillors up for election.</p>

    <p>We need your help finding out which wards actually have an election, and how many seats are available in those elections.</p>


    <h3>1. Go to the <a href="{{ object.authority.website }}" target="_blank">council's web site</a></h3>
    <p>Often you're looking for something called 'election notices'.
    <br>These are normally PDFs.</p>
    <p>
      {% if object.authority.election_urls %}
        {% if object.authority.election_urls.1 %}
          We think you'll find this information on one of these pages:
          <ul>
            {% for url in object.authority.election_urls %}
              <li><a href="{{ url }}" target="_blank">{{ url }}</a></li>
            {% endfor %}
          </ul>
        {% else %}
     You might be able to find <a href="{{ object.authority.election_urls.0.URL }}"target="_blank"><strong>more information about the elections here</strong></a>
        {% endif %}
      {% endif %}
    </p>


    <h3>2. Phone the council</h3>
    <p>If the web site doesn't tell you anything useful, you can <a href="tel:{{ object.authority.phone }}"><br><strong>call them on {{ object.authority.phone }}</strong></a> and:</p>
    <ol class="indent">
      <li>Ask to speak to their Democratic or Electoral services team</li>
      <li>Ask that team which wards are up for election on the 5th of May, including the number of seats available in each ward</li>
      <li>Remember that the council will get a lot of calls, so you might be put on hold or not be able to speak with the right person on your first call.</li>
    </ol>
