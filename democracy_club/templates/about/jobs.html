## Elections assistant

This is a short-term contract (Feb 2019 to May 2019, at least 4 days a week) for someone who can help us make a giant leap forward in voter information for the local elections next May.

### What’s happening next year?

We plan to boost informed turnout at the local elections on 2 May 2019. Around 30 million people will have the chance to vote.

We hope that our polling location data and finder will cover all councils and that we’ll have useful information on every candidate.

### What will you do?

* Help us partner with local authorities to publish polling location data: deal with queries; track progress towards completion; and manage the workflow of queries from the public
* Help us partner with data re-users: pitch to local journalists and newspapers, campaigns and community organisations
* Get more and better data on candidates: work with parties, agents, candidates and our incredible network of volunteers
* Manage an open hustings database, with the possibility of running Democracy Club hustings too
* Help manage our team inbox, social media and Trello boards
* Help with press and PR for Democracy Club
* ...and anything else you can convince us that you should work on

### What skills, experience and behaviours do you need?

* Politeness, curiousity and critical thinking
* Good written communication skills
* Enthusiasm for digital and democracy and the space where they meet
* Great social skills and the ability to work with people of high technical knowledge and none
* Well-organised: there will be lots of things happening at once
* Non-partisan: you should not be actively involved in any political party

### What we can offer:

* A chance to immerse yourself in civic technology, get up-to-speed in tech for good and digital, and to help save democracy.
* £10/hr

### I love democracy, this looks brilliant, how do I apply?
