## Python Developer

We are looking for a python developer to help with our polling station finder,
candidate website, internal tooling and associated infrastructure.

You will maintain [existing codes bases](https://github.com/democracyclub), manage data updates and work on new
projects and features across all of our services.

Your work will be used by millions of voters in the UK trying to answer simple
questions about their democracy. You will fit into a small team who work
remotely by default. The initial focus will be on delivering services for a
complex set of elections in May 2021.

### What skills, experience and behaviours do you need?

* Passionate about digital and democracy and the space where they meet.
* Non-partisan (you should not be actively involved in any political party).
* Comfortable with home or remote working.
* We expect everyone in Democracy Club to adhere to our [code of conduct](https://democracyclub.org.uk/code-of-conduct/).
* Be comfortable working in a light agile way, with daily standups, sprint
 plans and open working.
* Have the right to work in the UK

### Technical skills

Our stack is mostly Python and Django and PostgreSQL, hosted on AWS with code on
GitHub. Experience in any of these is useful, but if you need to work on new
skills we can offer mentoring or training. We support learning on the job and
rearranging tasks to suit the skills of the best applicant, so if you’re excited
to work with us we’d love to hear from you even if you’re not sure you’ve got
the right skills.

Beyond this, some nice to haves are someone who:

* Understands CI setups (We use a mix of CircleCI and Travis).
* Can write clear documentation for public facing APIs and internal processes.
* Has used REST APIs and understands good API design and usage patterns.
* Knows about UK boundaries and address data. This is optional, but a lot of the work
  involves navigating the nuances of this data.
* Has an understanding of deployment pipelines, server monitoring and administration .

### Time and Money
Salary of £40,000 pro rata, with office and hardware budget.
  We are offering an initial 1 year contract with optional renewal. We are flexible on
  work time, but are looking for a commitment of at least 4 days a week. Holiday
  and pension provided.

### Application Process
Please send us a CV and cover letter. Your covering letter should be no more than a page and tell
  us why you would like to work with us and think you'd be a good fit for the role. Make sure to
  include your relevant skills and experience, and where you think you might need some support.

Applications will be anonymised before they are reviewed. If you would like to send us examples of your
  work then you are welcome to, however we might not look at them until the initial application has been considered.

If you have any questions about the application process please [get in touch](https://democracyclub.org.uk/contact/).


### About Democracy Club
Our vision is of a country with the digital foundations to support everyone’s participation in democratic life.

Our mission is to create those foundations by:

* Identifying areas for improvement in democratic engagement;
* Ensuring everyone has access to quality information on democratic processes, particularly on elections;
* Mobilising a non-partisan movement of volunteers for democracy.

We are a small team running a non-partisan Community Interest Company. We run the UK’s  polling station
  finder, an open wiki of candidates and a collection of other data, tools and services aimed at transparency
  and access to information about elections in the UK. We work with Facebook, The Electoral Commission, newspapers
  and many others to ensure that voters get access to the information they are looking for.

We don’t have a central office, and the team is spread across the UK. Working hours are flexible and we offer
  a budget for renting desk space. The paid team is part of a larger community that we affectionately call
  “wombles” because of their commitment to picking up scraps of democtatic information that we make more accessible
  to the general public.



## Future roles

Democracy Club is made up of lots of people doing things to make democracy work better. Most give their time voluntarily, because they love democracy. Hurray!

We also have a small staff team. We're not currently hiring, but in the past we've been known to look for:

* Python or frontend developers
* Designers
* User researchers
* Community organisers
* Fundraisers
* Evaluation people
* General mucker-inners (events, admin, finance, comms)
