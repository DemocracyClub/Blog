Democracy Club and others [got together recently](http://democracyclub.org.uk/blog/2014/06/21/lets-get-talking/) to share our plans and ideas for how to make democracy and elections better. We're very grateful King's College London for providing a home at short notice.

We all know that competing with the [election din from political parties](http://democracyclub.org.uk/blog/2014/06/26/a-fair-fight/) will be hard and collaboration will be critical. So the first thing we did was ask participants to map what election projects are out there.

Here's what we found, with some very broad categories... It's a starting point and we'd like to flesh it out, so here's the [editable version](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M9FYlMZ-G_xHip8qBEFsxLbO7BNWqYZZB5_kAT1u_6Y/edit?usp=sharing).
