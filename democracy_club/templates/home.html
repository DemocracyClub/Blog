This is surprisingly addictive!  The easiest thing to do is enter your postcode to see what we know about your constituency already.  

Then start googling to see if there's anything we don't know.  You can try google news, the local press, party websites, etc.

After you've done your constituency, you can take a look at the [list of all constituencies](http://yournextmp.com/numbers/constituencies) to full in the blanks.

Also, you can come and [talk to us about it on #YNMP on Freenode IRC](irc://irc.freenode.net/#YNMP)

For the programmers, we have an API that you can access here: [https://yournextmp.popit.mysociety.org/api](https://yournextmp.popit.mysociety.org/api).

All the [code is on github](https://github.com/mysociety/yournextmp-popit), pull requests very welcome!
