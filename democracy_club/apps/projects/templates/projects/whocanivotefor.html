People expect information about elections and candidates to be available online.

>I am looking for information on the candidates I am supposed to be voting for on Thursday.
    I cannot find anything on either candidate. If they cannot be bothered to get the
    information out there why should I bother turning out to vote???

We are making this happen: users put in their postcode and we show them everything we know.
    Ideally, this information includes a statement from the candidate, their photo and contact details.

The website saw 500,000 uses at the last set of local elections. It now covers all by-elections too.

It’s powered by our election data and our crowdsourced database of candidates.
