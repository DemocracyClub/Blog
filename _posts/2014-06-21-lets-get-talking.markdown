We have a lot of plans and ideas for how to make democracy and elections better, that we'll be blogging and emailing about over the coming months.

The thing we've found so far is that you do too!

There are so many people and organisations out there getting ready by writing code, gathering data, planning campaigns, running workshops and so on.  

It's exciting and a little overwhelming at times just trying to keep track of it all.

Wouldn't it be great if we all got together to talk about what we were doing?

Wouldn't it be better if we figured out that we could help each other?

## Introducing the [Democracy Club Unconference](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/democracy-club-tickets-11441621197#)

If you don't know, an [unconference][unconference] is a conference that's run by who attends.  Have something to talk about?  Great, turn up, put your name in a session slot and see who turns up.

It's a great way to get a large group of people talking, and we plan to try to capture all the conversations on the day and build on them collectively.


## Join us

We're hosting this event on the [28th of June 2014 in London](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/democracy-club-tickets-11441621197#).  We'd love it it you could turn up and join in the conversation.  We'd especially love it if you have a project you're working on that you can talk about.  Or Maybe you know someone who does?  Bring them along too!
